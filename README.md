**Custiomers and Orders - The lifeblood of any business!** 
Are the lifeblood of any business, This is the solution I tried for this, https://academy.anyoneai.com. a "Machine Learning Bootcamp", challenge.
Customers should be self-explanatory, it's just a list of customers, however Orders dataset is a little bit more complicated: each customer can have multiple orders, and each order can have multiple products with corresponding prices associated with the order.
